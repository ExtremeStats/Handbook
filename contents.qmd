##### Chapter 3
<div class="handbook-banner">
::: {.justify}
<p><strong>Outline:</strong> 
_This chapter continues the discussion from the previous chapter and
provides an introductory treatment of how to learn about extreme value 
distributions from data. It also sets the stage for the next chapter on Bayesian inference
for extremes._

##### Chapter 4
<div class="handbook-banner">
::: {.justify}
<p><strong>Outline:</strong> 
_This chapter continues the discussion on learning extreme value distributions 
from data, building on the previous chapter by introducing the Bayesian
approach to statistical inference. It highlights how Bayesian methods incorporate
prior knowledge, improve inference through hierarchical modeling, and apply to
extreme value analysis._

<hr class="book-rule">
##### Chapter 5
<div class="handbook-banner">
::: {.justify}
<p><strong>Outline:</strong> 
_This chapter explores statistical methods for modeling both extreme
values and the entire distribution of a variable. By integrating extreme value
theory with broader distributional modeling, it highlights how these approaches
can bypass threshold selection and clarify the role of explanatory variables in
shaping both high and low extremes._
</p>

</div>
<hr class="book-rule">
##### Chapter 6
<div class="handbook-banner">
::: {.justify}
<p><strong>Outline:</strong> 
_This chapter introduces regression models for extreme events, which
track how the risk of extremes shifts with covariates like time or temperature. The
core idea is to link covariates to the parameters of extreme value distributions
and learn those links directly from data._

:::
</div>
<hr class="book-rule">
##### Chapter 10
<div class="handbook-banner">
::: {.justify}
<p><strong>Outline:</strong>
_A key advantage of the methods covered below is their ability to capture both asymptotic dependence and asymptotic independence, offering greater
flexibility than many traditional approaches. A dataset comprising two compo-
nents of air pollution in the UK is used to illustrate the bivariate conditional
extremes model, while the spatial conditional extremes model is applied to gridded
temperature data across the Netherlands._

<hr class="book-rule">
##### Chapter 11
<div class="handbook-banner">
::: {.justify}
<p><strong>Outline:</strong> 
_While previous chapters focused on modeling multivariate extremes,
we now turn to dimension reduction methods. This chapter explores ways to
reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving key information relevant
to the analysis of multivariate extreme values._
</p>
:::
</div>
<hr class="book-rule">
##### Chapter 12
<div class="handbook-banner">
::: {.justify}
<p><strong>Outline:</strong> 
_We now move from the task of dimension reduction to the task of
clustering. As with dimension reduction, clustering for multivariate extremes is
a relatively recent addition to the statistical toolbox, and this chapter introduces
three available approaches._
</p>

<hr class="book-rule">
##### Chapter 13
<div class="handbook-banner">
::: {.justify}
<p><strong>Outline:</strong> 
_Graphical models for extremes reveal relationships between extreme
events in complex, interconnected systems. This chapter introduces key concepts,
recent advances, and demonstrates their application to analyzing flight delays at
US airports._
</p>
:::
</div>
<hr class="book-rule">
##### Chapter 14
<div class="handbook-banner">
::: {.justify}
<p><strong>Outline:</strong> 
_This chapter introduces statistical methods for modeling extreme events
in time series data. It covers both classical results and modern approaches that
capture the tendency of extremes to cluster over short time scales, and discusses
recent developments based on the conditional extremes framework detailed in
Chapter 10; a case study on persistent high temperatures in Talavera la Real,
Spain, illustrates the methods._

:::
</div>
<hr class="book-rule">
##### Chapter 15
<div class="handbook-banner">
::: {.justify}
<p><strong>Outline:</strong> 
_Extreme events often unfold across space, not just time. This chapter
introduces max-stable processes, which extend the generalized extreme value 
distribution to describe spatial extremes, capturing both how extreme events vary
across different locations and how they are related._
</p>
:::
</div>
<hr class="book-rule">
##### Chapter 16
<div class="handbook-banner">
::: {.justify}
<p><strong>Outline:</strong> 
_The previous chapter introduced the GEV model for spatial extremes;
here, we turn to Pareto processes for modeling threshold exceedances. While
exceedances are easy to define in a single location, the challenge now is figuring
out what ‘exceeding a threshold’ means across space._
</p>
:::
</div>
<hr class="book-rule">
##### Chapter 17
<div class="handbook-banner">
::: {.justify}
<p><strong>Outline:</strong> 
_Whereas the previous two chapters focused on spatial extreme mod-
els derived from asymptotic arguments, we now shift the paradigm by introducing 
subasymptotic models. These models aim to enhance inference by capturing
dependence at intermediate to extreme quantiles, rather than relying solely on
theoretical limits._
</p>
:::
</div>
<hr class="book-rule">
##### Chapter 18
<div class="handbook-banner">
::: {.justify}
<p><strong>Outline:</strong> 
_While previous chapters focused on modeling extreme events in space,
this chapter extends these ideas, concepts and methods to capture both spatial
and temporal characteristics. As shown below, modeling space-time dynamics of
extremes requires more than simply adding a time dimension to spatial models._
</p>

</div>
<hr class="book-rule">
##### Chapter 19
<div class="handbook-banner">
::: {.justify}
<p><strong>Outline:</strong> 
_Understanding cause-and-effect relationships in extreme events is cru-
cial across many applied fields. This chapter introduces key causal models,
explores methods for learning causal structures, and demonstrates their application
using real data from the Seine River network._

on generative models. It highlights the limitations of mainstream AI approaches
in simulating heavy-tailed phenomena and presents fresh solutions._
</p>
:::
</div>
<hr class="book-rule">
##### Chapter 21
<div class="handbook-banner">
::: {.justify}
<p><strong>Outline:</strong> 
_A further exploration of AI and extremes. While Chapter 20 show-cased 
how recent neural approaches can be used as generative models for extreme
events, this chapter focuses on novel neural methods for modeling extremes and
extrapolating beyond observed data._
</p>
:::
</div>
<hr class="book-rule">
##### Chapter 22
<div class="handbook-banner">
::: {.justify}
<p><strong>Outline:</strong> 
_Quantiles are the foundation of most risk management methods, but
they only account for how often extreme events occur, not how severe they are.
This chapter explores novel alternative risk measures that address this limitation,
discussing their strengths, mathematical challenges, and real-world applications
in finance and natural disasters._
</p>
:::
</div>
<hr class="book-rule">
##### Chapter 23
<div class="handbook-banner">
::: {.justify}
<p><strong>Outline:</strong> 
_Detection and attribution is about understanding how much of the ob-
served changes in climate—such as rising temperatures or stronger storms—can
be traced to human activities rather than natural variations. This chapter reviews
the topic from a statistical perspective, with a particular focus on detection and
attribution of extreme weather events._
</p>
:::
</div>
<hr class="book-rule">
##### Chapter 24
<div class="handbook-banner">
::: {.justify}
<p><strong>Outline:</strong> 
_This chapter provides an overview of evaluation methods for extreme
forecasts and projections, where predictive models are compared to available data.
The methods we discuss are based on decision-theoretic principles and the prin-
ciple of maximizing the information value in the prediction subject to a calibrated
risk assessment._

<hr class="book-rule">
##### Chapter 25
<div class="handbook-banner">
::: {.justify}
<p><strong>Outline:</strong> 
_Rainfall is a highly variable and complex phenomenon, making its sta-
tistical modeling challenging, especially when capturing both typical and extreme
events across space and time. This chapter explores the difficulties of modeling
rainfall extremes, the role of dependence structures, and how combining extreme
value theory and physical hydrometeorological knowledge can improve 
predictions, particularly for flood risk assessment._
</p>
:::

<hr class="book-rule">
##### Chapter 26
<div class="handbook-banner">
::: {.justify}
<p><strong>Outline:</strong> 
_Statistics of extremes is beginning to play a key role in wildfire science
by improving predictions of rare and severe wildfire events. This chapter explores
how extreme value theory can be extended to study spatial and temporal wildfire
dependence, integrate with physical fire spread models, and address emerging
challenges in fire risk assessment under climate change._
</p>
:::
</div>
<hr class="book-rule">
##### Chapter 27
<div class="handbook-banner">
::: {.justify}
<p><strong>Outline:</strong> 
_In this chapter, we illustrate the use of split bulk–tail models and
subasymptotic models motivated by extreme value theory in the context of
hazard assessment for earthquake-induced landslides. A spatial joint areal model
is presented for modeling both landslides counts and landslide sizes, paying
particular attention to extreme landslides, which are the most devastating ones._
</p>

<hr class="book-rule">
##### Chapter 28
<div class="handbook-banner">
::: {.justify}
<p><strong>Outline:</strong> 
_This chapter explores how extreme value statistics can improve finan-
cial risk assessment by estimating extreme losses, with a focus on challenges
posed by serial dependence in financial data. It compares two key approaches—
unconditional and conditional quantile estimation—and examines their implica-
tions for capital requirements, risk monitoring, and multivariate systemic risk
analysis._

</div>
<hr class="book-rule">
##### Chapter 30
<div class="handbook-banner">
::: {.justify}
<p><strong>Outline:</strong> 
_Brain activity is often analyzed through averages and central trends,
but extreme events—like sudden surges in electrical signals—may hold key 
insights into neurological conditions. This chapter explores how extreme value 
theory can be applied to brain signal data, particularly EEG, to better understand
abnormalities such as epileptic seizures._
</p>
:::
</div>
<hr class="book-rule">
##### Chapter 31
<div class="handbook-banner">
::: {.justify}
<p><strong>Outline:</strong> 
_This chapter presents two examples of extreme value analysis using
incomplete data. The first examines very long human lifetimes, and the second 
looks at large insurance claims—both showing that meaningful analysis of
extremes is still possible even when some information is missing._
