<p><strong>Conferences</strong> 

::: {.justify}
Many developments featured in this Handbook were first presented at the EVA Conference, a long-standing forum that brings together researchers and practitioners working on extreme value analysis. Since its inception, the EVA conference has played a central role in fostering collaboration and shaping the field. The EVA Conference traces its origins to the first meeting on *Statistical Extremes and Applications* (EVA 0), held in Vimeiro, Portugal, in 1983.

<p><strong>_Extremes_</strong> 

::: {.justify}
An indicator of the field’s vitality is the Springer journal <a href = "https://www.springer.com/journal/10687/">_Extremes_</a>, which regularly publishes novel methodological developments across all areas of extreme value statistics. While a range of other outlets feature work on the statistical modeling of extreme events, _Extremes_ is widely regarded as the leading journal within the extreme value theory community. Many of the central developments presented in the Handbook have been published in _Extremes_ or in other leading journals in the field.

<p><strong>Software</strong> 

::: {.justify}
This Handbook owes much to the publicly available software developed for extreme value analysis. A curated list of \textsf{R} packages for statistics of extremes is available at

Several \textsf{R} packages are used throughout the book, including <code>evd</code>, <code>evdbayes</code>, <code>evgam</code>, <code>evir</code>, <code>extRemes</code>, <code>extremis</code>, <code>ismev2</code>, <code>POT</code>, and <code>SpatialExtremes</code>. Additional packages are employed in specific chapters, and contributors acknowledge them where relevant.

<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong> 

::: {.justify}
Other meetings, such as EVAN (International Conference on Advances in Extreme Value Analysis), also provide valuable forums for discussion. Several networks devoted to extreme value theory are active; for example, in Scotland, the <a href = "https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/staff/danielacastrocamilo/glenglasgow-edinburghextremesnetwork/" target = "_blank">Glasgow–Edinburgh Extremes Network (GLE$^2$N)</a> has provided leadership for a range of activities and events, including <a href = "https://gail.ed.ac.uk/news-and-events/events/generative-ai-modelling-for-extreme-events-2025" target = "_blank">GAME 2025</a>—the first workshop on Generative AI Modeling for Extreme Events. A related network is also active in Italy.
