<p><strong>Conferences</strong> 

::: {.justify}
Many developments featured in this Handbook were first presented at the EVA Conference, a long-standing forum that brings together researchers and practitioners working on extreme value analysis. Since its inception, the EVA conference has played a central role in fostering collaboration and shaping the field. The EVA Conference traces its origins to the first meeting on *Statistical Extremes and Applications* (EVA 0), held in Vimeiro, Portugal, in 1983.

<p><strong>_Extremes_</strong> 

::: {.justify}
An indicator of the field’s vitality is the Springer journal <a href = "https://www.springer.com/journal/10687/" target = "_blank">_Extremes_</a>, which regularly publishes novel methodological developments across all areas of extreme value statistics. While a range of other outlets feature work on the statistical modeling of extreme events, _Extremes_ is widely regarded as the leading journal within the extreme value theory community. Many of the central developments presented in the Handbook have been published in _Extremes_ or in other leading journals in the field.

<p><strong>Software</strong> 

::: {.justify}
This Handbook owes much to the publicly available software developed for extreme value analysis. A curated list of \textsf{R} packages for statistics of extremes is available at
