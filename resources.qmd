<p><strong>Conferences</strong> 

::: {.justify}
Many developments featured in this Handbook were first presented at the EVA Conference, a long-standing forum that brings together researchers and practitioners working on extreme value analysis. Since its inception, the EVA conference has played a central role in fostering collaboration and shaping the field. The EVA Conference traces its origins to the first meeting on *Statistical Extremes and Applications* (EVA 0), held in Vimeiro, Portugal, in 1983!
